Each FinancialObject has various behaviors:
- i.e: getCompanyName, getLatestPrice, getActual, getYearAgo, etc..

This data can be retrieved simply by creating an object and calling the desired behavior.

However we have an issue that we don't know which object to create until the users sends a request.

- So we use reflection to create an object based on user input and we can use methods of that class
- this has an advantage of not being able to create the object first
